/*
 * This is a tester similar to the tester written in class.  It reads
 * words from a text file, then adds the words to two sets: A built-in
 * set class, and our utah_set class.  After reading the file, it
 * prints out all the words stored in the STL set object.  At the end
 * of the test, it prints out the sizes of both sets to see that they
 * are the same.
 *
 * After the test completes, I make sure the local variabls are properly
 * cleaned up.
 *
 * If the comments wrap lines, widen your emacs window.
